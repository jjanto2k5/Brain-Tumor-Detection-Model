# Brain-Tumor-Detection-Model

#Problem Description: Detect and classify brain tumors from MRI images into tumor vs. non-tumor (binary classification) and optionally into tumor types (multiclass classification) using deep learning. The system will take MRI image(s) as input and output a predicted label (tumor / no tumor) and a confidence score. For multiclass extension, labels can include common tumor categories if the dataset supports them. 

 

#Motivation / Real-world Relevance: Early and accurate detection of brain tumors significantly improves patient outcomes by enabling timely clinical intervention. Automated, reliable MRI image analysis can assist radiologists by reducing workload, providing second opinions, and improving diagnostic consistency—especially in resource-constrained settings.
